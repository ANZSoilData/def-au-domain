Silicification may also be associated with deep weathering profiles although not exclusively so; for instance, some limestones may be variably silicified.

Soil colours rarely match the chart colour chips perfectly. They should be matched to the chip closest in colour, or the nearest whole number in chroma where chips are not provided, for example chromas 5 and 7.
The soil colour is measured on the surface of a freshly broken aggregate of moist soil. Moisten the soil if it is dry. Record the colour when the visible moisture film disappears from the surface of the moistened broken aggregate. The aggregate should be held as close as possible to the colour chips. Take care not to smear the broken surface, as this can give an incorrect recording of the colour of the soil matrix.

  skos:definition """The following description of determination of field texture is adapted from Northcote (1979).
Field texture is a measure of the behaviour of a small handful of soil when moistened and kneaded into a ball and then pressed out between thumb and forefinger.
Take a sample of soil sufficient to fit comfortably into the palm of the hand. Moisten the soil with water, a little at a time, and knead until the ball of soil, so formed, just fails to stick to the fingers. Add more soil or water to attain this condition, known as the sticky point, which approximates field capacity for that soil. Continue kneading and moistening until there is no apparent change in the soil ball, usually a working time of 1â€“2 minutes. The soil ball, or bolus, is now ready for shearing manipulation, but the behaviour of the soil during bolus formation is also indicative of its field texture. The behaviour of the bolus and of the ribbon produced by shearing (pressing out) between thumb and forefinger characterises the field texture. Do not assess field texture grade solely on the length of ribbon.
The recommended field texture grades as characterised by the behaviour of the moist bolus are described. The approximate percentage content of clay (particles less than 0.002 mm in diameter) and silt (particles between 0.02 and 0.002 mm in diameter) are given as a guide. These percentages must not be used to determine a field texture, that is, do not use them to convert a laboratory particle size value to a field texture grade. Similarly, do not adjust a field texture grade when laboratory particle size data become available.""" ;

Unfortunately, slope lines, by definition, extend from a summit to the lowest point (Cayley 1859), which may be many kilometres apart. One must arbitrarily determine the effective top and bottom of the toposequence. These effective end points come where the slope line coalesces with other slope lines to form a ridge line or a course line* (Figure 2a). In practice, ridge lines and course lines are to be excluded from the toposequence (see earlier section on landform element height). One arbitrary rule that will exclude the ridge line is to put the top of the toposequence where the contour curvature exceeds 60Âº in 40 m. The course line may be excluded by the same rule, or by putting the bottom of the toposequence at a stream channel.
Any site can be located by its vertical and horizontal distances from the defined top and bottom of the toposequence. Drainage height (page 88) is one of these measures.

Where slope classes have been obtained by systematic sampling, define the classes using equal increments on a scale of the logarithm of the slope tangent, a procedure intended to normalise frequency distributions of observed slope (Speight 1971). Where the most common slope class is estimated by direct observation, it is thought that the estimate will compare with that calculated using the log-normal model.
Modal slope class determines the use of certain adjectives applied to landform patterns that are characterised by alternating crests and depressions. These are: rolling for moderate modal slopes (10â€“32%); undulating for gentle slopes (3â€“10%); and gently undulating for very gentle slopes (1â€“3%) (compare with Soil Survey Staff 1951, pages 161â€“165). The other slope classes, precipitous, very steep, steep and level, are to be applied as they stand. The terminology for simple erosional landform patterns based on relief and modal slope is given in Table 5.
Table 5 defines the category badlands by various combinations of high slope values and low relief values. These combinations imply extremely close spacing of streams or valleys. Specifically, if one assumes a sawtooth terrain profile, the valley spacing implied is less than 100 m in areas with 50 m relief and less than 30 m in areas with 5 m relief; these values appear to accord with usage.
Table 7 lists types of landform pattern in order of their typical class of modal slope. This table should not be regarded as definitive, for slope within each type of landform pattern may vary widely."""@en ;

The class boundaries given in Table 2, and repeated in Table 4, are simply boundaries separating slope terms in common use, adjusted to regular logarithmic intervals. They do not refer to observed natural clustering of slope values, since such clustering has not been shown to occur; nor do they relate precisely to boundary criteria for land use, which vary arbitrarily between organisations and which may change with advancing technology.
It may sometimes be advantageous to split each of the classes â€˜very gently inclinedâ€™, â€˜gently inclinedâ€™ and â€˜moderately inclinedâ€™ into two levels, the appropriate boundary values being 1.8%, 5.6% and 18%.
There may also be compelling reasons for using other schemes of slope classes. However, schemes that do not have constant class widths from low to high slope values can lead to problems in subsequent statistical work."""@en ;
