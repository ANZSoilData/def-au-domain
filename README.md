The ANSIS domain-model for soils, in the form of a set of classes and properties that define the entities ('features' in GIS-speak) that comprise the important concepts in soils.

The model is substantially based on the [Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook](https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4273240), and defines slots where the values from the 'vocabularies' defined in the adjacent repositories [https://github.com/ANZSoilData/def-au-asls-*](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/) may be used. 

Important prior work includes:

(i) [Soil Information Transfer and Evaluation System (SITES)](https://www.asris.csiro.au/downloads/Sites_v2.zip) 

(ii) [ANZSoilML](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML)
