# def-au-entity
A domain-model for soils, in the form of a set of classes and properties that define the entities ('features' in GIS-speak) that comprise the important concepts in soils.

THe model is substantially based on the Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook, and defines slots where the values from the 'vocabularies' defined in the adjacent repositories (https://github.com/ANZSoilData/def-au-asls-*) may be used. 

Important prior work includes:

(ii) [ANZSoilML](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML)
